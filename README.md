## Description
A website for tracking cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, etc.). The main idea is to view the basic statistics of a specific currency and then exchange it. There will be several separate endpoints for viewing currencies. There will also be an endpoint for the calculator and exchange. There will be a user profile with their current balance. The exchange will work with it (adding balance/subtracting balance).
